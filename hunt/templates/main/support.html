      This year's scavenger hunt features a CTF-style challenge setup, where
      there are a multitude of different problems that students will take online
      and in person to find and solve. Once you solve a problem correctly, it
      will solve it for your entire class, so make sure somebody in your class
      hasn't already solved a problem that you want to work on. Besides that,
      read problems, collect codes, and grab points!

    <h3>How do I submit a challenge?</h3>
    <p>
      Each challenge will result in a flag, or a code, you can submit these on
      the "Challenges" tab under the top right dropdown.

    <h3>How do I know if I've got it right? Is the website just wrong?</h3>
    <p>
      There is a single flag for every problem, and the formatting will be
      consistent for every problem. If you have a strong inclination that you
      have the correct answer and our website is incorrect, feel free to reach
      out to our organizers.

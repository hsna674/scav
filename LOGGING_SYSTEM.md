- Most active users and class performance

### üö© Flag Submissions Tracking

- **URL**: `/logging/submissions/`
- **Access**: Staff members only
- Complete history of all flag submissions
- Filter by challenge, user, class, or correctness
- Shows submitted flags, success rates, and points awarded
- Pagination for large datasets

### üéØ Challenge-Specific Analytics

- **URL**: `/logging/challenge/<id>/submissions/`
- **Access**: Staff members only

- Complete submission timeline

### üë§ User Activity Profiles

- **URL**: `/logging/user/<id>/activity/`
- **Access**: Staff members only
- Individual user activity history
- Personal statistics (submissions, success rate, points)
- Timeline of all user actions

### üèÜ Class Leaderboards

- **URL**: `/logging/leaderboard/`
- **Access**: Staff members only
- Class-by-class performance comparison
- Top contributors in each class
- Challenge difficulty rankings
- Customizable time periods

## What Gets Logged

### Automatic Activity Logging

1. **Login/Logout Events** - OAuth login/logout with timestamps and IP
2. **Page Views** - All main pages visited by authenticated users
3. **Flag Submissions** - Every flag attempt (correct/incorrect) with full details
4. **Challenge Completions** - When users/classes complete challenges
5. **Admin Actions** - Administrative activities in the system

### Detailed Information Stored

- **User Information**: Username, class year, IP address, user agent
- **Timestamps**: Precise timing of all activities
- **Flag Submissions**: Submitted text, correctness, points awarded
- **Success Metrics**: Success rates, completion statistics
- **Context Data**: Challenge details, categories, point values

## Admin Integration

### Enhanced Challenge Admin

- Direct links to view submissions for each challenge
- Bulk actions for releasing challenges
- Submission counts in list view

### Logging Models in Admin

All logging data is accessible through Django Admin:

- **Activity Logs** - Searchable by user, type, date
- **Flag Submissions** - Filter by challenge, correctness, class
- **Challenge Completions** - Track first completions and points
- **Page Views** - Monitor site usage patterns

### Quick Access

- **Navigation**: Staff dropdown menu ‚Üí "Activity Dashboard"
- **Admin Interface**: Enhanced with direct submission links
- **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

## Database Models

### ActivityLog

- Tracks all user activities with type categorization
- Stores IP address, user agent, and contextual details
- Indexed for fast querying by user, type, and timestamp

### FlagSubmission

- Complete record of every flag submission attempt
- Links to user and challenge with correctness tracking
- Points awarded and IP address logging

### ChallengeCompletion

- Records when users complete challenges
- Tracks class-level completions and first achievements
- Points earned and completion order

### PageView

- Monitors page access patterns
- Referer tracking and user agent analysis
- Anonymous and authenticated user tracking

## Security & Privacy

- **IP Address Logging**: For security monitoring and duplicate detection
- **Staff-Only Access**: All logging views require staff permissions
- **Read-Only Admin**: Logging entries cannot be modified through admin
- **Data Integrity**: Automatic logging prevents manual manipulation

## Performance Considerations

- **Database Indexing**: Optimized indexes for fast queries
- **Pagination**: Large datasets are paginated for performance
- **Efficient Queries**: Related data is prefetched to minimize database hits
- **Middleware Optimization**: Selective logging to avoid performance impact

## Usage Examples

### Finding Cheating Patterns

1. Go to Flag Submissions ‚Üí Filter by challenge
2. Look for unusual submission patterns or timing
3. Check IP addresses for shared submissions
4. Review user activity timelines

### Monitoring Class Progress

1. Visit Class Leaderboard
2. Compare completion rates between classes
3. Identify struggling students or classes
4. Track point accumulation over time

### Challenge Difficulty Analysis

1. Check Challenge Submissions for specific challenges
2. Review success rates and attempt counts
3. Identify challenges that may need adjustment
4. Monitor first completion patterns

### User Support

1. Access User Activity for specific users
2. Review their submission history and errors
3. Check login patterns and engagement
4. Identify technical issues or confusion

## Migration and Setup

The logging system is automatically configured and ready to use:

1. **Database Tables**: Created via Django migrations
2. **Middleware**: Automatically logs activities
3. **Signal Handlers**: Track login/logout events
4. **Admin Integration**: Enhanced admin interfaces
5. **URL Configuration**: Logging routes configured

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:

- **Export Functionality**: CSV/JSON data export
- **Advanced Analytics**: Graphs and charts
- **Real-time Notifications**: Alert for suspicious activity
- **API Endpoints**: Programmatic access to logging data
- **Automated Reports**: Scheduled email summaries
